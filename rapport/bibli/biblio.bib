  abstract = {The nucleolus is the most obvious and clearly differentiated nuclear
	sub-compartment. It is where ribosome biogenesis takes place, but
	it is becoming clear that the nucleolus also has non-ribosomal functions.
	In this review we discuss recent progress in our understanding of
	how both ribosome biosynthesis and some non-ribosomal functions relate
	to observable nucleolar structure. We still do not have detailed
	enough information about the in situ organization of the various
	processes taking place in the nucleolus. However, the present power
	of light and electron microscopy techniques means that a description
	of the organization of nucleolar processes at the molecular level
	is now achievable, and the time is ripe for such an effort.},

  abstract = {In eukaryotes, ribosome synthesis largely takes place in a specialized
	nuclear domain - the nucleolus. It has recently become apparent that
	this organelle is involved in the biogenesis of most cellular ribonucleoprotein
	particles (RNPs), as well as in cell-cycle regulation, making it
	central to gene expression. The field has traditionally acknowledged
	that each nucleolus is organized in three morphologically distinct
	compartments. Here, however, we discuss our view that in fact many
	eukaryotes have bipartite nucleoli. We propose that, during evolution,
	a third nucleolar compartment emerged at the transition between the
	anamniotes and the amniotes, following a substantial increase in
	size of the rDNA intergenic region. We believe that these conclusions
	have important implications for understanding the structure-function
	relationships within this key cellular organelle.},
